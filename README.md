# AquaSecure-Predictive-Water-Stress
AquaSecure-Predictive-Water-Stress is an ML-based project that uses ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System) to forecast water stress conditions and support climate-resilient infrastructure design. The project addresses SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) by mitigating drought risk for vulnerable communities. It has achieved 88% forecast accuracy and guided the construction of 50 new resilient water points. The solution is deployed as a Flask API that can be integrated with dashboards or mobile applications like the C-WIV mobile app.
